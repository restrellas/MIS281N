I read the 2024 breaking into data engineering roadmap article in which it explains that the basics that comes with the job which include SQL and Python, distributed compute such as Snowflake and Spark, Orchestration knowledge such as Airflow and Databricks workflows and data modeling and data quality. At the moment I think I have the python and SQL skills but I am missing all the other ones. Its an interesting read as it explains the workflow of where each technology is used in the industry and why they are important.
